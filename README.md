# Unsupervised Learning: Kmeans Clustering on Country Data
This repository contains the project titled Unsupervised Learning - K Means Clustering of data of all countries based on their socio-economical factors. The HELP organisation is looking to provide financial aid to countries which in economically backward and in direst need of the aid. The HELP organization has raised around USD10 million and wants to effectively manage and distribute that funding to the countries in need.

The contents in this repository are explained below :- 
* 'Categorized_Countries_World_Map.png' - World map showing countries classified in clusters with the visualization constructed using plotly 
* 'unsupervised_learning_kmeansclustering-2.ipynb' - Python notebook containing the code
* 'unsupervised_learning_kmeansclustering_2.pdf' - Pdf version of the python notebook containing the code

# Task:
Classify the countries in categories based on their socio-economic and health factors which determine the overall development of the country.

# Data description:
There are 10 socio-economic and health factors for 167 countries.

# Method:
For this analysis, I opted for KMeans Clustering out of the other algorithms like Hierarchical Clustering. I have carried out a thorough process in this project.

1. Data Collection and Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis - with useful insights
3. Visualizations of the important features
4. Managing outliers in the data
5. Scaling the data
6. Model building - Finding optimal number of clusters
7. Model fitting and predicting the cluster labels
8. Exploring the characteristics of each cluster
9. Conclusion

The code for this project is in the following pdf file - [unsupervised_learning_kmeansclustering.pdf](https://github.com/Vatsal-2414/Country-Data-Kmeans-Clustering/files/10825124/unsupervised_learning_kmeansclustering.pdf)

In addition, the clustered countries are highlighted in a world map which can be seen in this image file - [Categorized_Countries_World_Map.pdf](https://github.com/Vatsal-2414/Country-Data-Kmeans-Clustering/files/10825164/Categorized_Countries_World_Map.pdf)
